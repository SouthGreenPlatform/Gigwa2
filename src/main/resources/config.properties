# You may specify under this property, a csv list of hosts for which this instance will drop temporary variant collections on startup (e.g. 127.0.0.1:27017,another.server.com:27018).
# Temporary variant collections are often used once a search has been completed, for browsing/exporting results. They are normally dropped upon user interface unload, but some may remain if the web-browser is exited ungracefully or the application goes down while someone is using the search interface.
# If this property does not exist then the instance will drop all found temp collections, if it exists but is empty, none will be dropped.

# Any property named onlineOutputTool_N with N being an integer >= 1 is a way for defining an online output tool for datasets exported to server. N accepts consecutive values (if only onlineOutputTool_1 and onlineOutputTool_3 exist then only onlineOutputTool_1 will be taken into account). The property value must consist in semi-colon-separated values. The first one is the label to display for this tool, the second one is the tool URL (in which any * character will be replaced at run time with the export file URL). The third value is optional and may contain a comma-separated list of file-formats (must match some of those that the Gigwa instance is able to export: BED, DARWIN, EIGENSTRAT, FLAPJACK, GFF3, HAPMAP, PLINK, VCF), thus defining those accepted by the tool (if unspecified, files in any format will be made available for this tool).
